# driver-distraction-detection-via-hybrid-CNN-LSTM
Develop an intelligent system to address the critical issue of driver distraction by designing and implementing a hybrid CNN and LSTM model that can accurately detect instances of distraction among drivers in real-time.

Driver distraction is a critical safety concern on our roadways, with potentially life-threatening consequences, this project presents a novel approach for driver's distraction detection using a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. The proposed system combines the spatial feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the temporal modelling capabilities of LSTMs to effectively capture and analyse distractions in real-time. In hybrid model, the CNN component processes visual input data, such as images or video frames, to extract spatial features that characterize driver behaviour. These features are then fed into the LSTM component, which accounts for the temporal context and dependencies within the data. By combining these two powerful neural network architectures, we can identify and classify a wide range of distraction behaviours, including texting, phone calls, eating, and adjusting in-car systems, drowsiness, talking to passenger etc. This approach holds the promise of significantly enhancing road safety by providing an intelligent system that can alert drivers and authorities to potential distractions, thereby reducing the risk of accidents. This hybrid CNN-LSTM approach offers a promising path towards safer and more reliable transportation systems, ultimately saving lives on the road.
